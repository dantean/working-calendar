# The Working Calendar

Created by Joseph Monticelli


## Description

It's a simple calendar application that allows the user to create, edit, and delete events on a timeline. 

## Acceptance Criteria


GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule

WHEN I open the planner

✅ THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar

WHEN I scroll down

✅ THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours of 9am&ndash;5pm

WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day

✅ THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

WHEN I click into a timeblock

✅ THEN I can enter an event

WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock

✅ THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage

WHEN I refresh the page

✅ THEN the saved events persist


## Future Development

I intend on re-visiting this application and adding additional functionality, like a checklist feature that can be added to each individual day, and expanding the calendar to cover a full month
